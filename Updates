===Wednesday March 26===

We need to agree to an object whose instrinsic lock will be
used to synchronize the visualizer and the transformer.

I vote the Queue<int[]> object.

Visualizer:

	synchronized(queue)
	{
		while(!queue.isEmpty())
		{
			queue.wait();
		}
		// utilize
	}
	
Also, we need to discuss how to kill the visualizer. A few options:
-Have the visualizer try to detect if a second without any new
 entries to the queue has passed. If so, kill itself.
-Have the main thread interrupt the visualizer, though this will
 require us (me) to review the lectures.
-Share another variable boolean keyrunning between the main thread
 and the visualizer.
 
I implemented a visualizer using only java.awt. There is a way to 
have a window without the minimize, maximize, close buttons on the 
title bar but I haven't figured it out yet. An image for buffering
and the window's update method had to be overwritten to have the
visualizer display the complete set of bars without flickering.
